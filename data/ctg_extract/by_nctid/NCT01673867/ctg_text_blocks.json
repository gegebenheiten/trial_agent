Subjects are eligible if CNS metastases are asymptomatic or treated and subjects are neurologically returned to baseline for at least 2 weeks prior to enrollment. In addition, subjects must be either off corticosteroids, or on a stable or decreasing dose of ≤10mg daily prednisone (or equivalent) - Subjects with carcinomatous meningitis - Subjects with active or recent history of known or suspected autoimmune disease. Subjects with Type 1 diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism only requiring hormone replacement, or skin disorders (vitiligo, psoriasis, or alopecia) not requiring systemic treatment are permitted to enroll - Subjects with a condition requiring systemic treatment with either corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive medications within 14 days of randomization - Prior therapy with anti-programmed death-1 (anti-PD-1), anti-programmed cell death ligand 1 (anti-PD-L1), anti-programmed cell death ligand 2 (anti-PD-L2), anti-cluster of differentiation 137 (anti-CD137), or anti-Cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (anti-CTLA-4) antibody (including Ipilimumab or any other antibody or drug specifically targeting T-cell co-stimulation or checkpoint pathways) - Prior treatment with Docetaxel - Treatment with any investigational agent within 14 days of first administration of study treatment Other protocol-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria apply",
